# Maze Runner

Learn to use the Random module with nested lists and store the results in a file.

Mazes are amazing: keep running and find the exit if you can! If you are not too happy about getting stuck in an actual maze, you can entertain yourself with a virtual one. In this project, you will write a program that generates mazes and looks for a way out.
