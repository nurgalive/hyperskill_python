# Learning progress tracker

https://hyperskill.org/projects/326

Project from the Hyperskill for learning Python.

> Practice loops and flow controls, functional decomposition, and SOLID principles. Learn how to process strings and leverage the unittest framework to make sure that your code is error-free. Use suitable collections such as lists to sort and filter data.

## About

Online learning is gaining popularity. A good education platform can manage registrations, track learning progress, send notifications and newsletters to many users worldwide. It is a huge volume of work indeed. In this project, you will build an application that keeps track of the registered users, their learning progress, and metrics. It will also provide detailed information about each user or any category of users and the overall statistics for the entire learning platform.

## Topics learned

- SOLID
- OOP and classes
- unittest
- regexp
- map, filter, sort
- hash functions

## Usage

`back` used to go back.

`exit` to exit the program.

`add students` adds students to the system.

`list` shows ID of all added students.

`add points` adds points for the courses to the Submissions.

`statistics` shows info about courses based on the submissions. Typing course name afterwards, will print top learners for the course.

`notify` generates emails for students, who have finished the courses.

## Project stages
Stage 1: Setup the core of your program: read input, detect a pre-defined set of commands, and respond accordingly.

Stage 2: Verify new users by checking their registration information. In this stage, your program should read information about users from the console and verify that it matches certain patterns.

Stage 3: Adjust your program to store the learning progress. Your program should be able to verify that the provided information has the right format and update the user records accordingly.

Stage 4: Output the statistics about students and courses. Teach your program to calculate and output the details about the courses based on multiple criteria.

Stage 5: Find out who the best students are and send personal messages to them.
